# Throttle Position Sensor Control System

## Project Overview

This project presents a robust throttle control system that utilizes two throttle position sensors (TPS) to precisely regulate the amount of air entering an engine's intake manifold. 
The system leverages a fault detection model to identify potential errors arising from either sensor or both simultaneously, ensuring enhanced safety and reliability.

## Key Features

- **Dual Throttle Position Sensors:** Employing two sensors increases redundancy and enables error detection for improved safety and system integrity.
- **Fault Detection Model:** This model effectively isolates and pinpoints malfunctions within the sensor system, allowing for timely corrective actions.
- **Model in the Loop (MIL) Verification:** This approach rigorously validates the behavior of the developed model under various simulated operating conditions.
- **Software in the Loop (SIL) Validation:** The SIL methodology guarantees that the generated code aligns with anticipated outcomes, promoting code reliability.

## System Architecture

A detailed block diagram depicting the system's architecture will be included here. 
It should visually represent the interactions between the two TPS sensors, the fault detection model, the engine control unit (ECU), and the intake manifold.

## How It Works

1. **Sensor Data Acquisition:** The system continuously gathers data from both throttle position sensors.
2. **Fault Detection Model Processing:** The collected sensor signals are fed into the fault detection model, which meticulously analyzes them to detect any anomalies or inconsistencies.
3. **Error Identification and Correction:** If the model identifies a fault (e.g., sensor malfunction, sensor disagreement), it promptly alerts the system, enabling the implementation of corrective measures.
4. **Airflow Control:** Based on the processed sensor data (assuming no detected faults), the system meticulously regulates the amount of air flowing into the intake manifold, optimizing engine performance.
5. **MIL and SIL Integration:** MIL and SIL methodologies are seamlessly integrated to rigorously test the model and code, ensuring their effectiveness and reliability.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Safety:** The dual sensor setup and fault detection model significantly improve system safety by mitigating the risks associated with sensor malfunctions.
- **Improved Engine Performance:** Precise air intake regulation leads to optimal engine operation, potentially resulting in better fuel efficiency and power output.
- **Increased Reliability:** The system's robustness and error-handling capabilities contribute to overall system reliability and dependability.
